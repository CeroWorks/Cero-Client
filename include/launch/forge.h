/*
 * Forge support covers two eras:
 *
 * - Legacy (1.6 - 1.12.2): the installer jar embeds the full launch
 *   profile directly as install_profile.json -> "versionInfo" (no
 *   install-time processing needed). Forge itself runs as a regular
 *   classpath jar under net.minecraft.launchwrapper.Launch, selected via
 *   a "--tweakClass <FMLTweaker>" argument extracted from the profile's
 *   "minecraftArguments" string.
 *
 * - Modern (1.13+): the installer + processors method. It downloads the
 *   real Forge installer jar, extracts its install_profile.json + merged
 *   version.json, downloads every library it lists, then re-executes
 *   each "processor" step (the same steps the official installer GUI
 *   runs) via plain `java -cp ... MainClass args...` calls.
 *
 * Neither path involves the Cero/Forge agent.
 *
 * NOTE: true pre-1.6 Forge (1.1 - 1.5.2) used raw binary .lzma
 * "binpatches" applied directly to the vanilla client jar bytes, a
 * completely different (and, today, extremely rarely used) mechanism.
 * That path is not implemented.

/*
 * NeoForge is a fork of Forge (split off at Minecraft 1.20.1) that keeps
 * the exact same installer + processors mechanism, so it reuses every
 * helper in forge.c (library resolution, data-token substitution,
 * processor execution). What differs is only:
 * - its own maven (maven.neoforged.net) and artifact coordinates
 *   (net.neoforged:neoforge instead of net.minecraftforge:forge)
 * - no "recommended" build concept: picking a version means fetching the
 *   release list and taking the latest one matching the Minecraft
 *   version's "<major>.<minor>" NeoForge-version prefix.
 *
 * NOTE: MC 1.20.1 shipped a transitional NeoForge release still using
 * Forge's own "net.neoforged:forge:1.20.1-<ver>" naming; that one-off
 * compat case is not handled here yet (use fetch_forge_profile for it
 * in the meantime, since it is artifact-compatible with Forge itself).
